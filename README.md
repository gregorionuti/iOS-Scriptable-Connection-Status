# iOS Scriptable Connection Status for NordVPN

This is a Scriptable widget that lets you display, IP address, IP address country, NordVPN connection status.
The widget background changes its color from green to red whenever the connection is not protected by NordVPN.
Users who don't whant to use NordVPN API, can switch to IPinfo api (in this case NordVPN connection status can't be retrieved).
